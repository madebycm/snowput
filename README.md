Snowput
=======

Snowput is a simple and RESTful API for MongoDB written in Ruby (on top of Sinatra). I am doing this beacuse:

1. I could not find any other satisfactory solutions out there
2. To learn and understand Ruby and MongoDB better

This project is currently under heavy development and not ready for production, but please feel free to send me patches or comments on the code.
